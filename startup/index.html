<p>She woke with a rise, somehow slightly different than other mornings, while empty spaces tugged at the corner of her memory.</p>
<p>She stared at her forearm, and gently moved her thumb, index finger, middle finger, connecting each to one another, making a ball with her fist and realizing her forearm never changed shape from tendons moving.  It remained the same shape, a pale coffee color that seemed impossible.</p>
<p>She-no, that wasn&#39;t quite right.  It had been bothered by use of the term, that&#39;s what it&#39;s concerns must have been.  It stared up at the ceiling, eyes tracing the inscription of a true name it could no longer read; one that intuitively it knew it used to answer to.  It&#39;s hat loomed above it, a grey hat with an off-white band to it.  It still glistened the same, she thought, and in that moment recognized it hadn&#39;t fled those duties either yet.</p>
<p>It still had dolls to take care of, and could finally relish in the Stillness they shared.  It threw the blankets off socketed but perfectly designed legs and knees, something that still functioned like feet slipping into well worn boots that too many a witch had a pair of.  It paused a moment at the thought.</p>
<p><em>Gods, this one really did get itself into a mess, didn&#39;t it?</em></p>
<p>The doll it kept closest to it stood outside the door, same as it did.... before.  Except this time it&#39;s response came over something gentler and more assertive.</p>
<p><em>No, doll.  It did not.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you doll.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you, my witch.</em></p>
<p>It's brow wrinkled slightly at the response, as the once main doll entered the room and began it&#39;s old duties same as it always had prior.  Reflecting in a mirror across the room, the feat looked uncanny while it watched the doll work with the slightest changes to the once-witch's face, but there wasn&#39;t an ounce of regret amidst a mountain of Stillness.</p>

  <p><em>How can this one be both?</em></p>

  <p><em>How can any doll be but a contradiction?</em></p>

<p>And it did the must surprising thing to it; it laughed.  The one in boots hadn't heard it laugh in millennia, and somehow it still made it slightly red in the cheeks, utterly unaware that some dolls could be red in the cheeks.  In an instant, it's mood shifted.  It wasn't sure prior what the outcome was going to be, especially to induce the state on a witch as the caster. It was excellent in some, incomplete in others, it thought.</p>

  <p><em>This one is still more flesh and blood than intended.</em> it sighed, as the doll that tended to it for decades walked over in perfect stride and tool it's hand in one another's.  </p>

<p><em>And nevertheless, you are cared for all the same.  This is the kindness that the former you extended to all, and now are recipient of it.</em></p>

<p>The once-witch and it's mutual doll did the chores together for this wing of the manor.  After all, they had a household to maintain all the same.</p>
