<p>the small glowed dimly in the room, an impossible shadow cast from the light it gave off.</p>
<p>warnings of sterility for the intermediate container, of proper use, a datasheet that was large enough to cover the building.  most of it was fluff though, the things that were tasked with writing it up simply injected a stream of consciousness.  filled it up in just under a minute.  after all, those types of minds are quick.</p>
<p>it&#39;s not normal to have an aide for this type of use, but she wasn&#39;t exactly underpaying it.  it was in search of Stillness, and there was no amount of hemming and hawing that&#39;d halt <em>that</em> compulsion.</p>
<p>It was as much an addict as she was.</p>
<p>The liquid was injected into a bag of saline, the faintly glowing liquid reminding her of jellyfish, the word lingering in her mind.</p>
<p>ageless, dangerous even after death, effectively immortal.  she was in many ways a jellyfish.  the loosely floating hair that glowed the same the more she took the dose was proof thereof.  </p>
<p>she knew exactly how many had died for her to get her dose, she did most of the hunting herself.  wasn&#39;t even sure it was death if they weren&#39;t living, but the question lingered at times.  She may have quipped with the agents who had formerly been assigned to capture her that it was her Purpose, but she wasn&#39;t joking when she said it.</p>
<p>besides, they were reassigned anyways.  It was much better now for all involved parties.</p>
<p>she flipped open the laptop next to her and began to type, the hospital bed firmly on the ground while she gently floated and the flickering halo turned solid once more, the drip gently coaxing her into a more Purposeful state.</p>
