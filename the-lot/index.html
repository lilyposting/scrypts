<p>the gentle flickering kept her company.  the cool concrete under her was company enough as she sat in the dim ambiance of the floodlight barely on at the end of the lot, her car turned off for hours, cool to the touch.</p>
<p>she breathed in deeply as the summer chill washed over her, her back flat on the ground amidst the twigs and debris, her backpack, originally pink now a darker maroon from dirt, was her pillow.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey... I miss you.&quot; she said, to no one in particular, looking at the glowing moon, the sunlight traveling millions of miles just to reflect into her eyes.  </p>
<p>It almost felt romantic, knowing she was still sharing the same sun as the girl she once knew.  she tried to not think about it.  even gods get lonely sometimes.</p>
<p>it still stung a little, so she reached into her backpack, pushing aside the stripey dyed purple hair that she hasn&#39;t had to re-color in decades to get out a thin bottle and her glasses.</p>
<p>she didn&#39;t need them for sun protection, but for spatial flattening.  their iridescent lenses started out as camera parts, then the experiments of some incredibly confused scientists, and now lived in her backpack.</p>
<p>so, with one faintly buzzing finger and an amber bottle, she bottled a sliver of the moon.  not enough that anyone would notice, but enough that once she got back, she could mold it into a small piece, grow some more in her regolith garden.</p>
<p>after all, someone needed to make a new solar system, and she wanted a diverse garden to work with.</p>
