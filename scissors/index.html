<p>her finger wrapped carefully around the brass surface, her slight fingernails tracing the shape of the divots in the frame, keeping them closed.</p>
<p><em>they mustn't slip, they mustn't slip.</em> she thought to herself, her montra of years.</p>
<p>the rules of the ceremony were as much pomp and circumstance as prep and caution.</p>
<p>if she slipped, the very fabric of the universe could be torn.</p>
<p>so when she turned the corner, and found herself staring at nothing, an impossible shape given an anti-form, all she could do was halt herself.</p>
<p><em>what happens if it gets them?</em></p>
<p>Her mentor, her ageless protégé that haunted her for years, their words echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>"Run to fight, fight to run, run to soar, soar to sleep."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and ducked around the corner, her flats slapping the asphalt with as much confidence as a feral animal.</p>
<p><em>Run to fight.</em></p>
<p>She took the scissors out of their sheath, the stork's eye catching the light, the hint of the bill glistening in the dim light as she snipped right at the middle of the shape, a careful miscalculation leaving it twinkling like stardust and the sky around it warping slightly as she bounced back and curved the corner, her flats not quite so on the coarse brick of the hall.</p>
<p><em>Fight to run.</em></p>
<p>She said a silent prayer to herself, and willed the stork's shears to six or seven feet tall, releasing a delicate pin in the middle, taking the wire retaining to put her hair up.  She knew the prophecies, and in all that moment, all she wanted to do was to end it.</p>
<p>She turned the corner and leapt to action, each jab dissolving more and more of the impossible shape, the dimmest flickering of a body revealing itself as she sliced the nothing from itself.</p>
<p><em>Run to soar.</em></p>
<p>She shrunk the blades and re-sheathed them, careful with the sewing kit to re-sew the space she destroyed to save herself, her own anti-body sitting on the ground in stardust form as she slowly healed the scars she'd made.</p>
<p>"I saved us.." she muttered.</p>
<p><em>Soar to sleep...</em></p>
